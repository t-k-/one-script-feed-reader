# About
This is a dead-simple feed reader.

It helps you read your feeds in file system instead of WEB-hosted interface.

Be aware for its simplicity (it is for my personal use), but also to believe: It is sufficient for a personal feed reader.

Prerequisites:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install feedparser
```
